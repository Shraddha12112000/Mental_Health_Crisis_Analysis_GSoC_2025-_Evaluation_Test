old and have been suffering from cardiac anxiety for about 3 years, but these past few weeks it\\u2019s been debilitating.\\n\\ni used to smoke a lot of weed. like a lot. one night i smoked and while walking back inside i got a little startled by my mom, my heart rate went up. i went up the stairs to my room, my heart rate went up more. this is when my heart rate wouldn\\u2019t stop increasing and i started feeling strange symptoms. i was very short of breath, my hands were tingling, and i was experiencing chest pains. as someone who has always loved to google medical conditions, i immediately believed i was having a heart attack and i began freaking the fuck out. big time. i started writing goodbye letters in my notes app. i went downstairs to tell my mom i was having a heart attack. turns out i was just stoned. \\n\\ni tried to smoke again the night after but i felt the same. i repeated this process of smoking and having a panic attack hoping it would ease my anxiety like it did for my family but it only made it worse. \\n\\nafter about 8 months i started smoking again but my tolerance was never the same, id take one hit of a joint and be on the brink of a panic attack because i could feel my heart in my chest, but as long as i kept talking to my friends i could get through it. none of them knew how i was feeling because i was embarrassed about it. at the end of november 2024 i got high for the last time because i genuinely thought i was going to die. i felt my heartbeat all over my body, it was beating FAST and HARD and i felt something in my chest that i can only describe as extremely uncomfortable. my entire body was weak, nearly numb. i\\u2019ve never felt anything like it. i tried to soothe myself for hours waiting for it to pass, i sat in my shower fully clothed because if i did die i didn\\u2019t want anyone to find me naked. sounds stupid, but i was scared and high. that night was the last time i smoked and i dont intend to do it again.\\n\\ni was excited for my newfound sober-ness because i believed it would make my symptoms go away and if anything i feel worse. one little thing can set me off and at least as far as i can remember, this is the hardest thing i\\u2019ve ever had to go through. i can\\u2019t walk to class because i fear getting my heart rate up will cause a heart attack. i can\\u2019t talk in class because im scared my just regular anxiety will make my heart rate go up and cause a heart attack. i get a little chest pain and it\\u2019s a heart attack. my left arm is a little sore and it\\u2019s a heart attack. earlier i experienced what i believe is precordial catch syndrome and i lost my mind. i paced around my dorm for 20 minutes intermittently, trying to see if i felt better lying down or walking around. i immediately downed 200 mg of hydroxyzine. i started looking up other people on reddit with cardiac anxiety and how they get through an episode. those last two are my solid routine.\\n\\nmy blood pressure is completely normal. in fact, all of my vitals are completely normal, my blood test was completely normal and i know this. logically, i know that i am not going to have a heart attack. there is no history of heart problems with my family. i dont live the healthiest lifestyle, i vape and im not particularly a very healthy weight. but both of my parents have been in worse shape than me for their entire lives, started smoking cigarettes and weed and drinking at 12. they\\u2019re still alive and kicking. i KNOW that theres no way im having a heart attack but the physical symptoms of my anxiety do not obey my thoughts. it creates a whole new fear of, \\u201cwhat if i get cocky, thinking it\\u2019s just my anxiety, and it really is a heart attack.\\u201d \\n\\ni feel like a fucking idiot talking to people about this, and they only scare me more than help me. if i approach the conversation from a \\u201cthis is just anxiety\\u201d standpoint, they urge me to go to the doctor to get my chest pains checked out. if i approach the conversation as if im genuinely concerned for my physical health, they\\u2019ll look at me like im crazy and telling me i should go to the doctor and get my anxiety medication figured out.\\n\\nwhat i say here isnt even half of what ive experienced, partly because there are a lot of things i just cannot put into words and i dont think ill ever find the words needed to convey what i feel. what ive learned from this is that im not invincible. i didn\\u2019t want to know that at my age. moving into college, you\\u2019d except to have the time of your life. partying every weekend, making new friends, hooking up with random people, and this WAS the truth. for about a month. i\\u2019ve lost friends because i can\\u2019t hangout with them if im having a bad day. truthfully, the only thing ive found that soothes me is alcohol. specifically alcohol, in my bed, completely alone. this was something i fell into when i was a sophomore in highschool but i thought i kicked it. you always think you\\u2019ll be the one to beat the generational addiction until you understand why it started in the first place.\\n\\nas i sit here writing this, (which frankly was not meant to be a vent, i wanted advice at first) i feel pain in my left arm because i worked out yesterday, my stomach hurts because im hungry and the pain is radiating to my chest, but the pain in the left side of my jaw is unexplainable to me. the one thing that i can\\u2019t explain will just make me think that everything else is a symptom of a heart attack, and i will go to sleep not expecting to ever wake up. when i wake up tomorrow morning, i will think im having a good day until im not. it\\u2019ll probably hit around 3pm. i wont be able to go to my class. i will have a panic attack. i will google. i will pick at my skin until i bleed. i will have 911 ready to dial because this time it surely is a heart attack. i will call my mom instead, crying because i just cant do this anymore. i will drink heavily until i fall asleep. it will repeat\",\n          \"12 years a NEET, my older sister is heading for deaths door (LONG) Me and my sister have lived the same life, divorced parents and moving around every other year. She used to play the role of an older sister feeling responsible for the younger brother and we had a good relationship making jokes and laughing all the time.\\n\\nShe has aspergers and used to be very social, organised and active albeit she was quite sensitive and sometimes was picked on. She had therapy and loads of treatment to help her concentrate in school and would usually take natural products like fish oil to concentrate and it really seemed like things would go OK for her.\\n\\nHowever, she would cry all the time in her room around when she first got to high school. And I mean all the time. Like it all just blends together. I was so used to it and feel I've blocked it from memory now but must have been every week or so for years. She would do attention seeking things like saying where is the deodorant so she can huff it and kill herself. My mum is still convinced my sister is possessed by an evil spirit or something just to punish her specifically.\\n\\nOne time we found her on the edge of the village bridge wanting to jump off. I knew she wasn't going to do it but at the time, I was so numb to her antics that I really started to despise her and to be honest, I still do. My confidence was lower knowing my once protective sister had become so fragile despite all the help she got even from me. I'm 27 and have never spoke to a therapist in my life nor asked anyone for help even in my toughest days when I was getting my career started in another country away from friends and family.\\n\\nOne time as a teen i was going through an identity crisis and needed support. I mistakenly told my sister about it who snapped back at me saying how little my problems mattered and she was suffering all the time. I never told her about any of my problems since then and nor to any of my parents as I had already lost much of my trust after the divorce when I was 7.\\n\\nShe kept going on and on about how scared she was about life and exams and would have these nervous breakdowns all the time and it would be the same thing over and over like a broken record.\\n\\nShe left school at 16. She had decided not to even attempt her exams. Eventually she took up a job cooking for something like a year or less but of course her defeatism got the better of her and has been living in a council flat all paid by the taxpayer for the past 12 years and hasn't moved a muscle since.\\n\\nI can barely look at her anymore. I can't understand how different we are in how we've handled challenges in life especially considering she always had mum there for her and therapy. I had my own difficulties in school and becoming my own man without a father figure but I had to set aside my own problems because my sister was always starting drama to the point where my mum was almost going crazy at her with the shouting matches.\\n\\nShe is morbidly obese and has been getting catoonishly bigger and bigger somehow for the past few years. Her legs are in pain. She sits at home all day eating chocolate and fast food (she didnt leave the flat for a few years at one point) and whenever I'm visiting and we talk about being 'productive' she explains that she watches TV and that counts as her doing something. She's not even interested in video games or anything remotely interactive and she used to enjoy having a DS back in the day and i couldn't even convince her to get back into it so that she can actually do something a little worthwhile.\\n\\nLast Christmas she stayed in the bathroom for almost an hour because she was in pain trying to get up. I had to leave early because I just couldn't stand it anymore. I felt disgusted its got to this point. I've explained to my mum over and over how this lifestyle is actively killing her and she's only 28 years old.\\n\\nI want to add to further complicate things. She's now apparently developed schizophrenia as of a few years ago. Problem is shes had multiple diagnosis saying bipolar etc and she gets a new diagnosis every year and I'm having a tough time following honestly. Im not sure what to believe since shes made up stuff before not to discredit any diagnosis. Her tranq dosage was upped and not only can she barely walk but she is passing out in the afternoon and sleeping all the time. On the phone she talks like she has alzheimers and has very slurry speech. I haven't been able to communicate with her properly now but honestly, I think I've given up on her for the sake of my own sanity.\\n\\nI'm sorry I might come off as someone who doesn't care. The truth is, I spent a long time trying to. Recently I had to explain this to my gf. She herself is an older sister to two brothers and comes from a good stable family. Something our family had potential to be but made the wrong choices and may have started this mess to begin with.\\n\\n\",\n          \"No motivation to do anything anymore and I think I'd be better off dead. [21F] Hello everyone. I need to vent, and I have no one to vent to, I wish I could get some support, but I know this post will get ignored like most of mine do because nobody cares about me. \\n\\nI haven't gone outside in God knows how long, and if I have it's been for a very short while, a couple hours at most. I haven't gone to school almost the entire year, and I'm in my final year of university, I'm probably not graduating. My mother will be very disappointed in me and I don't even want to think about how she'll abuse me when she finds out I'm likely not gonna finish university after she helped pay some of my tuition. I have no motivation to go to school, I haven't had any since I enrolled, and over the last three years I've been in school I've tried to motivate myself without success. Each year I just had less and less attendance. I don't want to learn anything, I feel exhausted and drained, I don't like any field, I'm not interested in any careers, and unfortunately if I want a job with a liveable wage in my country I not only need my bachelors degree but I should also complete masters. I can't take a break because I know I won't start again if I do, plus, I would need to get a job, because my mother isn't going to let me sit and do nothing. I can't motivate myself to get out of bed and go to school, let alone work a shitty job that's probably not even gonna pay well. \\n\\nI am very lonely, and it hurts so bad, that only fuels my isolation, because I have nothing to go outside for. I hate strangers, I hate crowded places and I don't want to hang out places with less people because I am a woman and scared for my safety, the only reason I would have to go outside for would be friends or a partner, and I have neither. Before you go and say that \\\"of course you don't have a social circle if you never go outside!\\\" I've been outside my entire damn life and I still never made any friends. I've been to school, places people my age hang out, extracurricular activities etc. over the years yet I haven't ever had real or proper friends, why would it be any different now? \\n\\nI'm also incredibly unattractive, I'm fat and ugly and while theoretically I could fix the fat part in practice I can't without slipping back into ED territory like every time I tried to lose weight over the years, the thought of dieting again is extremely distressing and triggering for me. I'm also weird as fuck and have an unappealing personality because I'm autistic on top of everything so I can't even attract someone with that. Although even if I had a great personality people wouldn't give a shit because the outside is repulsing. \\n\\nI feel so useless and hopeless, I wish I could just die somehow, I've tried numerous times over the years to commit suicide yet I've always been unsuccessful because I've always been too much of a pussy to do it properly. I've been self-harming for a long time now just to cope with it all. I'm too scared to try to commit again, because what if something good is waiting for me? Then again, I couldn't possibly regret it, because I'd be dead. I don't see any other way out of my pain and anguish other than death, I've tried so hard for so long to get better and nothing works, I've only gotten worse.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1455,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"feel like im going nowhere feel like im never gonna go anywhere despite hard im trying im im gonna turn month two weeks terrified get older everything ive done far amounts actually nothing im trying hard classes get good grades im trying things help get collages stuff dont see things like going collage getting degree happy life js cant see know still need grow stuff im afraid growing im afraid cant see living next years ultimate plan unalive time turn im afraid live dreams ambitions younger wanted singer worked voice till throat raw today quit choir motivation context choir year sucks nobody actually wants sing participate sound like dookie love choir always quit one thing going dont know motivation anyways im sad abt quitting loved ik quit feel like im gonna loose everything like everything gonna fall apart feel like nobody thats scary im scared dont know anymore\",\n          \"ive cheated times im scared im actually going insane update within past weekmaybe little weekmy paranoia gotten even worse ive panic attacks almost daily girlfriend always ill calm yesterday finally admitted fuller detail whats going ive upset lately understands given history another breakdown two days reddit post tried explain things loud couldnt get words ended showing post could understand going head even couple weeks made first reddit post things got really bad one night went phone againshes never given reason trust couldnt stop myselfand found something random upset wasnt even anything serious lost ended waking yelling got backandforth wasnt yelling anything aggressive seemed confused anything yelling cryinglike fullon sobbing snot tears pouring face eventually turned full panic attack told could leave room wanted id understandbut stayed said knew wasnt okay stayed held shook calmed yesterday opened told everything ive paranoid latelymainly fear shes cheating impossibly specific things literally way true thing know shes shes nothing like exes shes kind trauma know would never someone knows exactly im scared knows whats eating away im gonna say havent accused basically much im paranoid havent like really said dont even believe thoughts truebut still keep creeping completely overwhelming almost constantly made change phone passwordand still dont know refuse let know think access spiral fullblown panic attack dont check dont want either us even still sometimes ill notice phone screen shes asleep ill sit staring like minutesnot touching itjust spiraling head point heavy breathing tears going face finally force turn screen walk away always tells go phone anytime need ask cant get feel like horrible boyfriend feel like im abusive like majority exes feel like im good enough feel like im even meant relationship every time ends betrayal yet im happy ive never close anyone hasnt either dont want ruin havent therapy meds almost two years ive diagnosed bpd schizoaffective disorder stuff dont wanna get know thats part whats fueling still every time try talk someoneany friend anyone alli feel like im dramatic overexaggerating people say understand given ive still feel like none justified ive never taken intentionally try hard mean controlling im scaring ive seriously thinking checking hospital havent inpatient since lately ive getting old urge even briefly ive clean almost years started im turn body already covered scarsi dont want urge come back even minute terrifying know starting affect see even though keeps telling fine shes understands im scaredit still kills im putting weight right im seriously considering admitting hospital next days know need help\",\n          \"need help get loop hello hope well arent feeling well know finished exams exactly week ago havent feeling lately going follow lot interests cant move life nothing feels different weird feel restless cant get anything done even finished ols feel like isnt yet like havent written exam yet im yet write really affecting anyone get im going crazy\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
